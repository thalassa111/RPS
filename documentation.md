# Rock Paper Scissors

## Work flow

Early in the course we already knew our last assignment was going to be a game based on Rock, paper and scissor so I had already planned roughly how it would look and what would be in it. The result looked a bit basic but still gives and idea of the layout. I included picture files, one is a kinda lofi design and the other one is a more accurate design with working buttons and some coloring I was trying out at that time. I later changed to another color scheme.
At that time the first prototype with code was based on flexboxes since we had not mentioned anything about grids. I tried a couple of ways and played around with different effects such as hover over buttons etc. Later in the course we were introduced to the grid system, then I knew this was the way to go of course.
When I had the basic layout done roughly I started with the canvas, wasn’t sure how I wanted the animation to be. First I thought maybe the player pick and the AI pick can just go towards each other and then the loosing one will vanish. Then I thought about a couple other methods, but later decided to go with this slot reels based thing.
I implemented it into the page in the middle and then made everything around it, trying to place buttons and everything as visible as possible. At this point we had learned about DOM and how to access information from the html file through javascript so I used it quite a lot.


## Own reflections

The main thing I wanted was some kind of animation based on a canvas containing javascript, since that is what we learned last course and it was quite fun so I wanted to use this new knowledge. I wasn’t sure about multiple pages since this project is quite small and there really isn’t that much information to be shared, and also a computer screen has a larger width than height, so I was thinking maybe all can fit on just one screen and be turned on or off.
I think the course was pretty nice in a way that we got our last assignment really early, so every time we went through something new, I had in my mind how and if this could be implemented somehow in this last assignment, and also I was able to test out. Of course some things you would still go out and research on your own. But for example, I was going with flexboxes first, but then we went through grids so I changed it, and also when we went through the DOM system I was thinking about rebuilding the whole page, was thinking maybe I can build the whole page through DOM manipulation, and pretty much skip a lot of html, not sure if its a good idea though.
I wanted to make the game best of three, not just one and then new game. So came up with the idea of having three different reels but player can only pick one, everything is still random. Also had the idea of implementing Fire, one who would win versus all.


## Description of Design
In the end I chose to have a single page, since there wasn’t a lot of information to be shared, with the choice of hiding parts of it. Some links will lead to other pages and I also used iframe for a relevant video scene from the series “friends”.  I wanted to only have a couple buttons, no more than necessary, then I styled them to kind of have the same theme. Wasn’t sure about the pictures first, but then I thought this cartoony style fitted perfect.


## Interaction design and usability
In the end I chose an easy color palette to fit for all user, from black to white, but tried many different colors before since it is quite easy to just change background and text colors. To make the site more accessible I used the attributes alt, role and title for description of the different tags. I also tried to use appropriate tags for the different sections of the html code, but sometimes it gets a bit confusing about which to use, and it seems like both could be right. For the interaction part the site is kept to a minimum without anything unnecessary, for the actual game there are really only 4 buttons to press, one for each choice and another button to start a new game.
Depending on the size of the screen, the different sections will change from horizontal to vertical positioning to handle, and I also played around a little with the cursors.
